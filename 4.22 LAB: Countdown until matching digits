/*
Write a program that takes in an integer in the range 11-100 as input. The output is a countdown starting from the integer, and stopping when both output digits are identical. Note: End with a newline.

Ex: If the input is:

93
the output is:

93 92 91 90 89 88
Ex: If the input is:

11
the output is:

11
Ex: If the input is:

9
or any value not between 11 and 100 (inclusive), the output is:

Input must be 11-100
For coding simplicity, follow each output number by a space, even the last one.

Use a while loop. Compare the digits; do not write a large if-else for all possible same-digit numbers (11, 22, 33, â€¦, 99), as that approach would be cumbersome for larger ranges.

    {
