/*
Write a program that takes in a string that holds the values "day" or "night" and an integer that holds a person's age, and outputs a movie ticket price. Movie prices are free for everyone under the age of 4. Daytime prices are $8 for everyone age 4 or higher. Nighttime prices are $12 for ages 4 - 16, $15 for ages 17 - 54 and $13 for ages 55 and above.

Ex: If the input is:

night 50
the output is:

$15
Ex: If the input is:

day 15
the output is:

$8
Ex: If the input is:

night 3
the output is:

free
