/*
Statistics are often calculated with varying amounts of input data. Write a program that takes any number of non-negative integers as input, and outputs the max and average. A negative integer ends the input and is not included in the statistics. Assume the input contains at least one non-negative integer.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved by executing cout << fixed << setprecision(2); once before all other cout statements.

Ex: When the input is:

15 20 0 3 -1
the output is:

20 9.50

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

int main()
{

   int num;
   int max = 0;
   double avg;
   double sum;
   double totalRun = 0.0;

   cin >> num;

   while (num >= 0)
   {
      sum += num;
      totalRun++;
      if (max < num)
      {
         max = num;
      }
      cin >> num;
   }
   
   cout << fixed << setprecision(2);
