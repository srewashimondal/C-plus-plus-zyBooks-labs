/*
In computer animation, a "jiffy" is commonly defined as 1/100th of a second. Define a function named JiffiesToSeconds that takes a float as a parameter, representing the number of "jiffies", and returns a float that represents the number of seconds. Then, write a main program that reads the number of jiffies as an input, calls function JiffiesToSeconds() with the input as argument, and outputs the number of seconds.

Output each floating-point value with three digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved by executing
cout << fixed << setprecision(3); once before all other cout statements.

Ex: If the input is:

15.25
the output is:

0.152
The program must define and call a function:
double JiffiesToSeconds(double userJiffies)
*/




#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

double JiffiesToSeconds(double userJiffies){
   return (userJiffies / 100.00);
}

int main() {
   double userJiffies;
   double seconds;
   
   cin >> userJiffies;
   
   seconds =  JiffiesToSeconds(userJiffies);
   cout << fixed << setprecision(3) << seconds << endl;

   return 0;
}
