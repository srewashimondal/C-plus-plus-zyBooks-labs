/*
Given four values representing counts of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies, output the total amount as dollars and cents.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved by executing
cout << fixed << setprecision(2); once before all other cout statements.

Ex: If the input is:

4 3 2 1
where 4 is the number of quarters, 3 is the number of dimes, 2 is the number of nickels, and 1 is the number of pennies, the output is:

Amount: $1.41
For simplicity, assume input is non-negative.
