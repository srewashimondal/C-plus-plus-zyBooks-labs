Instructor note:
Remember from 2.14 that you can't store a number larger than 2 billion as an int variable?

long long is another data type, like int or double, but that can hold larger numbers in memory. You can use long long (yep, twice) when you are working with integers expected to exceed 2 billion. For now, just treat a long long like a really large integer. Read through 2.17 "Numeric data types" (optional) if you want more information.

Given a long long integer representing a 10-digit phone number, output the area code, prefix, and line number using the format (800) 555-1212.

Ex: If the input is:

8005551212
the output is:

(800) 555-1212
Hint: Use % to get the desired rightmost digits. Ex: The rightmost 2 digits of 572 is gotten by 572 % 100, which is 72.

Hint: Use / to shift right by the desired amount. Ex: Shifting 572 right by 2 digits is done by 572 / 100, which yields 5. (Recall integer division discards the fraction).

For simplicity, assume any part starts with a non-zero digit. So 0119998888 is not allowed.
